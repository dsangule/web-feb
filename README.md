## Note
Hello everyone,

We are writing to update you on the progress of our project, JNU Sayz, a community website for JNU students and faculty. We have completed the main features of the website, such as the notices, event info, and club information sections. However, we have not been able to finish the blog backend section, which allows users to create and interact with blog posts on various topics.

The reason for this delay is that we have faced some technical challenges and difficulties in implementing the blog backend section. We have also encountered some bugs and errors that required major time and effort to fix. We are working hard to overcome these issues and complete the blog backend section as soon as possible.

We request your patience and cooperation as we try to deliver a high-quality product that meets your expectations. We appreciate your feedback and support on our project and hope to share the final version of JNU Sayz with you soon.

Thank you,
Team Void
